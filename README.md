this is the second mini exercise/project. We chose to orient this around the capstone and focus on creating the backend server and its connections. The goal personally is to update at least the user login to meet the minimum requirements of CRUD design.

How to run this
 - pull dependencies with npm i
 - create a schema for mysql
 - set env info for mysql server
 - run "npm run server" // alt npm run dev depending on deployment choice

 should fire up so long as those base steps are taken
